    = consider reworking the sweeping mechanic. 
    what if instead of disappearing, leaves would instead pile up? hold lmb and move forward to stack leaves. 
    leaves can be put into a garbage bag - one by one or as a part of pile. put all leaves into garbage bags! bags can hold a certain amount of leaves
    
    =this died due to optimization. i will give it another try with gpu leaves and using shader parameters as input and output
