CURRENT WORKING NAME - LEAF SWEEPER

- smooth transitions in settings menu
- consider reworking the sweeping mechanic. what if instead of disappearing, leaves would instead pile up? hold lmb and move forward to stack leaves. leaves can be put into a garbage bag - one by one or as a part of pile. put all leaves into garbage bags! bags can hold a certain amount of leaves
- add 'new upgrade notification'
- add the ability to throw your broom. it will then proceed to sweep all the leaves as it slides across the ground. 
- each broom has it's own secondary attack. broom - throw, 
- strong broom - slide. you hold rmb and accelerate in a selected direction,
- feather duster -
- vacuum - powerful aoe leaf blow!
- prevent broom from activating when clicking in pause menu
- add input delay to button manager to prevent accidental clicks
- fix pause menu horizontal scaling
- add pause menu functionality. gallery, options, exit fade out. gallery and options - add an enum that determines whether to go to title or just queuefree and return to pause menu etc

- fix null checks, replace them with is_instance_valid()
- set locale on first launch
- disable menu buttons during transition
- COME UP WITH A NAME FOR THE GAME!!!
- come up with a name for a chara.
- work on economy :D
- make in-game UI
- in-game UI should have control tooltips with gamepad glyphs
- add completion UI, with our chara holding thumbs up! add a grade based on time. D, C, B, A, A+, S. Each grade has a cash bonus. info shown - grade, time, level name. grade is an enum where -1 means no grade, otherwise grade.
- during completion, you can move and look at the results of your work. the completion is initially just a text popup (Press blah to finish)
