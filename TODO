    = DON'T ADD ANY MORE FEATURES. PERIOD. =
    
    = consider reworking the sweeping mechanic. 
    what if instead of disappearing, leaves would instead pile up? hold lmb and move forward to stack leaves. 
    leaves can be put into a garbage bag - one by one or as a part of pile. put all leaves into garbage bags! bags can hold a certain amount of leaves
    
    =this died due to optimization. i will give it another try with gpu leaves and using shader parameters as input and output
    
    CURRENT WORKING NAME - LEAF SWEEPER
    
    GAMEPLAY:
        = cash based broom that uses cash to clean ?
        - level-specific leaf cleaning leeway
        - disabled leaf populator completely breaks the game, pls add safety checks
        - add 'new upgrade notification'
        - add completion UI, with our chara holding thumbs up! add a grade based on time. D, C, B, A, A+, S. Each grade has a cash bonus. info shown - grade, time, level name. grade is an enum where -1 means no grade, otherwise grade.
		- save best grades and show them in stage select
        - during completion, you can move and look at the results of your work. the completion is initially just a text popup (Press blah to finish)
        - maybe implement optimization via cluster of multimeshes
        - figure out some sort of way to prevent leaf spawning under props. heightmaps do that, but are a hassle. maybe we could generate heightmaps via raycast or some sort of other method?
        - draw camera texture (don't forget the outline!)
        - sunflower-like tutorial. mention leaf highlighting (could tutorial be a dialogue with the girl?)
        - redo brooming animations
        - add the ability to throw your broom. it will then proceed to sweep all the leaves as it slides across the ground. 
        - each broom has it's own secondary attack. broom - throw, 
        - strong broom - slide. you hold rmb and accelerate in a selected direction,
        - feather duster - auto cleaning ?
        - vacuum - powerful aoe leaf blow! (4-5 radius)
        - work on economy :D
        - add fountain stage (make it night/evening!)
        - add park stage
        - add broom upgrades
        - cash and purchases saving
        - fix not being able to leave photo mode
        - add photo mode zoom, and tilt
        - suggestion - make the leaf highlight not an inherent mechanic, but an upgrade?
        - set ranking times on levels !!!
