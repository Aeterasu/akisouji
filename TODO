+ fix crash. start game, pause, exit to menu, start game again. boom, crash.
+ add pause menu. resume, gallery, settings, quit.
+ redesign pause menu
+ fix ui disappearing on restart
+ disable menu buttons during transition
+ fix gallery not showing hint
+ optimize leaf generation via gdextension
+ add pause menu functionality. gallery, options, exit fade out. gallery and options - add an enum that determines whether to go to title or just queuefree and return to pause menu etc
+ fix html cursor capture on pause menu etc
+ gallery gamepad controls
+ fix pause menu horizontal scaling
+ pressing lmb on scroll bar in gallery opens an image. plsfix.

= DON'T ADD ANY MORE FEATURES. PERIOD. =

= consider reworking the sweeping mechanic. 
what if instead of disappearing, leaves would instead pile up? hold lmb and move forward to stack leaves. 
leaves can be put into a garbage bag - one by one or as a part of pile. put all leaves into garbage bags! bags can hold a certain amount of leaves

=this died due to optimization. i will give it another try with gpu leaves and using shader parameters as input and output

CURRENT WORKING NAME - LEAF SWEEPER

- (?) gallery keyboard controls
- settings horizontal scaling
- add interpolations to ui
- add playstation glyphs
- port map completion, leaf interpolation and particles from gdscript leaf cleaning to C++
- remove output console, as it's kind of pointless now that we use GDExtension. 
- add credits to main menu
- smooth transitions in settings menu
- add 'new upgrade notification'
- add the ability to throw your broom. it will then proceed to sweep all the leaves as it slides across the ground. 
- each broom has it's own secondary attack. broom - throw, 
- strong broom - slide. you hold rmb and accelerate in a selected direction,
- feather duster -
- vacuum - powerful aoe leaf blow!
- prevent broom from activating when clicking in pause menu
- add input delay to button manager to prevent accidental clicks
- fix null checks, replace them with is_instance_valid
- set locale on first launch
- COME UP WITH A NAME FOR THE GAME!!!
- come up with a name for a chara.
- work on economy :D
- make in-game UI
- in-game UI should have control tooltips with gamepad glyphs
- add completion UI, with our chara holding thumbs up! add a grade based on time. D, C, B, A, A+, S. Each grade has a cash bonus. info shown - grade, time, level name. grade is an enum where -1 means no grade, otherwise grade.
- during completion, you can move and look at the results of your work. the completion is initially just a text popup (Press blah to finish)
- beautify gallery scroll wheel
- add some sort of download screenshots from web version. also hide folder button in web
- beautify leafs. new texture, maybe random texture
- maybe implement optimization via cluster of multimeshes
- check out TODOs in code and implement them ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
- figure out some sort of way to prevent leaf spawning under props. heightmaps do that, but are a hassle. maybe we could generate heightmaps via raycast or some sort of other method?
- draw camera texture
- add settings menu. master, sfx, ambience, music volume. fullscreen/windowed. language. leaf higlight color setting. fov - 70-100. controls. mouse sensitivity, gamepad sensitivity. -AUDIO, -VISUALS, -GAMEPLAY, -KEY BINDINGS, -GAMEPAD BINDINGS
- settings saving
- finish alleway stage. patch holes, really.
- add fountain stage
- add park stage
- add props by necessity
- add stage select menu
- add broom upgrades
- add upgrade purchase menu
- cash and purchases saving
- add crunchy cleaning sounds
- add general sound. now that I think about it, there won't be much sound in the game, will it?
- rework footstep sound
- add camera sound
- add ambience
- redo brooming animations
- fix that annoying gate texture that currently uses deafault metal and looks ugly
- force tanya to draw our pretty chara
- add chibis
- sunflower-like tutorial. mention leaf highlighting
- rework loading screen
- add music
- convert meshes to glb to save space
- some sort of music playlist manager and music ui
- web optimizations
- optimize mesh loading for web, cut out the blend files.
- cut out everything unused
- add russian, and if possible, japanese localization
